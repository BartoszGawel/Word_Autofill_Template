ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
â”œâ”€â”€ vacation.xlsx           # Excel file with employee vacation data
â”œâ”€â”€ vacation.docx           # Word template with placeholders
â”œâ”€â”€ holiday_requests/       # Output folder for generated Word documents
â”œâ”€â”€ generate_requests.py    # Main Python script

How It Works
Reads data from an Excel file (vacation.xlsx) containing vacation details for each employee.
Loads a Word template (vacation.docx) with placeholders like Name, Surname, Start_date, etc.
Replaces placeholders with actual data from each row in the Excel file.
Saves a personalized Word document for each employee in the holiday_requests folder.

Excel Format
Your Excel file should contain the following columns:

Name
Surname
Position
Line_manager
Start_date (as a date)
End_date (as a date)

Type (e.g., annual leave, sick leave)

Word Template Format
Use placeholders in your Word document that match the column names in the Excel file. Example placeholders:

Name

Start_date
End_date
Total_vacation_days

These will be automatically replaced with actual values.
